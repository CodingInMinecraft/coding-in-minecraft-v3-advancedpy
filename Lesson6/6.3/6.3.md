# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 6.3 - Python - Modularity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Modularity** is a key concept in coding.

In previous lessons you have used loops to repeat actions multiple times. 

This allowed us to run the same code multiple times rather than having multiple lines of code performing the same action.

Modularity allows for re-use of code and a reduction in code repetition.

Modularity is the process of splitting your code into smaller re-usable pieces. Each piece may be fully functional on its own or contain common functionaility which may be reusable.

Modularity can sometimes be referred to as creating procedures, functions or sub-routines.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Modularity - Reducing Code Repetition & Reusing Code**

Reducing code repetition is the process of reducing the use of same or similar code in your program. This allows for easier maintenance of our code later.

In the below example, we have a series of steps being performed in code. Notice the same lines of code are repeated.
(Note some code has been removed for brevity.)

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Modularity - Reducing Code Repetition & Reusing Code**

We may be able to use a loop to reduce the number of times similar code is used however this is not always possible - e.g. if we want slightly different code to run on each loop enumeration or different code to run between enumerations.

An alternative would be to move the repetive code into a separate **function** which can be called when required.

When we call a function all lines of code in that function run before the next line of code after the function call.

In this example, we have moved the 3 lines of code which repeat into a separate Python function called doSomething. This function is then called to run the 3 lines of code where required.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Modularity - Reducing Code Repetition & Reusing Code**

In this example, (repeated below) when the player enters the word run into the chat window the code within the player.onChat event handler will run as normal. 

Each line of code within the event handler would run as before, one after the other. 

When the below line is reached

```python
doSomething()
```

This line of code is calling a Python function - a function which we have named doSomething. When the function is called the lines of code un the function run in order and once the last line of code in the function has run the next line of code after the line of code calling the function runs.

In the below example, this means that if we look at the 3rd time we call doSomething the 3 lines of code in the doSomething function will run then the following line of code will run:

```python
mobs.spawn(COW, agent.getPosition())
```

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Functions**

Functions can be created in Python by using the function doSomething block in the ``||FUNCTIONS: FUNCTIONS||`` drawer or using the below code. 

**Python**
![alt text](https://advancedpyv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson6/6.3/images/4.jpg?raw=true "Python")

The word doSomething is the name of the function and you can change this to something more descriptive of what the function does.

All of the code which will run when we call the function is under this line and indented by 1 level.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Functions**

To call a function you just need to use the function name followed by brackets.
```python
do_Something()
```

## Step 7 @unplugged
**Commenting code**

Once you start to create functions it can be a good idea to start adding comments to your code.

Comments are used to describe what your code is doing and is just extra text in your code which has no affect on your code running.

Comments are great to remind you of what a line or piece of code does when you come back to look at it at a later date.

Its good practice to add comments to your code to describe what the code is doing should anyone else need to understand it later.

There are 2 types of comments in Python - single line and multi line. 

Single line comments are for adding in a single line of text comment and can be added at any point in your code by starting a line of code with 2 forward slashes (```python # ```).

Multi line comments are for adding comments which require more than a single line. Multi line comments start and end with `  """ `.

## Step 8 @unplugged
**Example**

Can you understand the below code by reading the comments? You can run it by moving onto the next step.

```spy
player.onChat("buildWall", function () {
    //Teleport the Agent near the player
    agent.teleport(pos(2,0,2), WEST)
    //Give the Agent 64 bricks blocks in slot 1
    agent.setItem(BRICKS, 64, 1)
    //Set the Agents active slot to 1
    agent.setSlot(1)
    //Repeat process 6 times
    for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        //Call buildLevel function to build 1 level/storey
        buildLevel()
        //Reposition Agent on top of first block placed
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.move(BACK, 10)
    }

})

/*Function to build a single level 
of a wall 10 blocks long*/
function buildLevel() {
    //Set the Agent to place blocks when they move
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    //Move Agent forward by 4 blocks
    agent.move(FORWARD, 10)
    //Set the Agent not to place blocks when they move
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
}
```

## Step 9 
**Example**

Can you understand the below code by reading the comments? You can run it if you wish.

```template
player.onChat("buildWall", function () {
    //Teleport the Agent near the player
    agent.teleport(pos(2,0,2), WEST)
    //Give the Agent 64 bricks blocks in slot 1
    agent.setItem(BRICKS, 64, 1)
    //Set the Agents active slot to 1
    agent.setSlot(1)
    //Repeat process 6 times
    for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        //Call buildLevel function to build 1 level/storey
        buildLevel()
        //Reposition Agent on top of first block placed
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        agent.move(BACK, 10)
    }

})

/*Function to build a single level 
of a wall 10 blocks long*/
function buildLevel() {
    //Set the Agent to place blocks when they move
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    //Move Agent forward by 4 blocks
    agent.move(FORWARD, 10)
    //Set the Agent not to place blocks when they move
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
}
```

## Step 10 @unplugged
**Code Attribution**
Comments can also be used to give attribution to code which you have reused. 

A lot of the time someone else may have already created the code which will do what you want to do in code.

Rather than creating the code yourself sometimes code can be shared by others for anyone to use for free. 

Most of the time all that is asked of you if you use the code is to give attribution to the orignal code author.

Attribution is the process of recognising the oringal creator and/or where the code orignally came from and is good practice to do even if the orignal author doesnt require it.

In simple terms attribution is adding a comment to your code detailing the name and/or web address of where you obtained the code from.
