# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 6.2 - Python - Semantic Errors

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Python Semantic Errors**

Semantic errors can be very difficult to find and are the result of a logic error in your code.

Semantic errors usually do not stop your program from running but usually result in your program not functioning as you expect to.

This could be for example:
- Looping around a loop one to many times

- Setting the value of a variable incorrectly

- The logic of a boolean condition being mixed up

- Improper indentation resulting in a line of code not being in an if statement or loop

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Looping around a loop one to many times**

Having a loop run an incorrect number of times is a common semantic error and an easy one to make.

Take for example if we want to have the agent build a wall of blocks in length you might use a for loop as in the below code

## Step 3
The code has been provided below, run the code and observe what happens and return to Code Builder (remember to give your Agent some inventory!).

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.
```spy
player.onChat("buildWall", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
    for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

```template
player.onChat("buildWall", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
    for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
```

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Looping around a loop one to many times**

If we run this code you will notice that the agent builds a wall of 5 blocks rather than 4.

Can you spot why the wall is 5 blocks long rather than 4?

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Looping around a loop one to many times**

The issue is with the for loop - notice the loop control variable (called index) starts at 0 and we are looping for 5 enumerations.

If we walk through the code the first time the loop runs index is 0, the second time index is 1, third time index is 2, fourth time index is 3 and the fifth time index is 4 - the loop stops enumerating when index is updated to 5 on the sixth iteration of the loop.
Therefore the contents of the loop run 5 times in total - one too many that what we would like.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Looping around a loop one to many times**

The issue here is that we are looping one too many times.

There are 3 methods we could use to ensure our loop runs only 4 times, not 5 as it does currently.

If we change the loop to enumerate 4 times by changing the 5 to 4 in the in range() part of the for loop it will mean the value of index will be - 0, then 1, then 2, then 3 and the loop will stop enumerating after 4 times.

## Step 7 @tutorialCompleted
Change the loop to enumerate 4 times rather than 5 by changing the 5 to 4 in the in range statement on line 4.

Run the code again and you should see it performs as expected.

Once complete move onto the next Activity.

        agent.place(BACK)
    }
})
