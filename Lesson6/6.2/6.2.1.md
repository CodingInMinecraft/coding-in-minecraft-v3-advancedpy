## Step 1 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable incorrectly**

In this example we want to lay gold blocks beneath our feet wherever we walk.

## Step 2
The code has been provided below, run the code and observe what happens and return to Code Builder.
```template
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    blocks.place(GOLD_BLOCK, pos(-1,0,0))
})

```
## Step 3 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable incorrectly**

When we run the program, however, a gold block is placed behind us each time we move but it it placed on the ground rather than below our feet.

Can you spot why this?

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable incorrectly**

Look carefully at the pos(-1, 0, 0) code - this is a relative position 1 block behind us on the X axis, and the same block on the Y and Z axis.

To fix we change the X part of the coordinate to be 0 and the Y part of the coordinate to be -1 which is the relative position 1 block below us.

If we run the program again, we should see that block are now laid in the ground as we wanted.

## Step 5 @tutorialCompleted
Change the position to be 0, -1, 0.

Run the code again and you should see it performs as expected.

Once complete use your agent device to do Activity 2.
