## Step 1 @unplugged
**The logic of a boolean condition being mixed up**

In this example we have created some code which we want to perform the following action:

When the user enters the mine command the agent should be teleported to the player and mine whilst there are blocks in front of the agent.

**Python**

## Step 14 
The code has been provided below, return to the game and position yourself in front of some of the blocks placed earlier and run the code and observe what happens and return to Code Builder.
```template
player.onChat("mine", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    while(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD) == false) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.collectAll()
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
})
```
## Step 2 @unplugged
**The logic of a boolean condition being mixed up**

If you run the code however you should notice that the agent stops when they encounter a block in front of them and will mine whilst there are no blocks (i.e. air blocks) in front of them. This is the opposite of what we want to do.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**The logic of a boolean condition being mixed up**

The issue here is that we have the boolean logic which controls our while statement incorrect.

The  ```while agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD) == False: ``` while statement will loop around while the agent does not detect a block in front of it.

To fix change the boolean false value to true so that the logic is that the loop will run as long as the agent does detect a block in front of it.

## Step 4 @tutorialCompleted
Change the boolean condition in the while loop from False to True and run the code and observe what happens and once complete move onto the Assessment Challenge!

        agent.collectAll()
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
