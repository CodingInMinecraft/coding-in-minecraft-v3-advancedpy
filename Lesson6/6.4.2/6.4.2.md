## Step 1 @unplugged
**Errors Assessment Challenge 2**

This challenge will prove your skills in finding **semantic** errors.

##Step 2 
**Errors Assessment Challenge 2**

You want your code to build the basic 4 walls of a house (each wall is 5 blocks high and 5 blocks long) for you to manually complete later.

The basic algorithm for your code is as follows:

- Move the agent to the players position 
- Move the agent forward by 1
- Set the agent to place blocks when the move
- Set the agent to destroy any blocks in their way
- Loop around for each level of the house, moving up one level on the Y axis after each iteration
- Loop around to place 5 blocks for the wall
- Turn left

In the below code there are 3 semantic errors.

Can you identify them and provide a resolution to the errors?

To submit your answer please complete the student worksheet linked to by the Non Player Character and submit to the student portal.
```template
player.onChat("house", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 2)
    }
})
```
```spy
player.onChat("house", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, false)
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 2)
    }
})
```
