# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 6.3.1 - Functions Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Functions Activity**

In this activity we will use functions to make sections of our code reusable.

We will take some code which builds a tower and change it to be able to be used in mulitple places in our code.

## Step 2

The below code has been provided which will build a 2 x 2 tower of sandstone. 

```template
player.onChat("tower", function on_on_chat() {
    agent.setSlot(1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        for (let index2 = 0; index2 < 4; index2++) {
            agent.setItem(SANDSTONE, 16, 1)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)
    }
})
```
Return to the game and run the code and observe what happens. 

Return to Code Builder and continue the tutorial after you have run the code.

## Step 3 @unplugged
If we wanted to build multiple towers there are a number of methods we could use to do this:
- We could copy and paste the code and have the same code multiple times

- We could use a loop around this code 

- We could move the code into a function and call the function multple times

The third option is the preferred option as it means there is only one copy of the code and the code can be called from multiple places.

## Step 4 
At the end of the code create a new function named buildTower by entering the below Python code:

![alt text](https://advancedpyv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson6/6.3.1/images/2.jpg?raw=true "Functions")

This is known as defining a function.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
function buildTower() {

}
```

## Step 5
Move all of the code from the onChat Build event handler to the buildTower function.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
function buildTower() {
    agent.setSlot(1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
    agent.setAssist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, true)
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        for (let index2 = 0; index2 < 4; index2++) {
            agent.setItem(SANDSTONE, 16, 1)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        }
        agent.move(UP, 1)
    }
}

player.onChat("tower", function () {
	
})
```
## Step 6
For the code in the function to run we need to call the function.

To do this enter the name of the function (buildTower) followed by a set of bracket/parenthesis where you want to call it. In our case we want to call the function in the player.onChat event handler.

Once you have added the code return to the game and test your code out by entering the text tower into the chat window and a small tower should be built.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("tower", function () {
    buildTower()
})
```
## Step 7
At the moment there is no difference when running the code - it still create one tower. 

What if we wanted to create multiple towers?

To have multiple towers, we will need to move the agent to a new position. 

After the ` buildTower() ` code add a new line and from the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer place a ``||AGENT: Agent Assist on ||`` block and make sure the place on move is set to False. 
We needed this step so that when the agent moves to its new position, it does not place down blocks. 

After that line from the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer place a ``||AGENT: Agent Move||`` block on the new line and change the direction to Left and the number to 3.

After that line from the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer place a ``||AGENT: Agent Move||`` block on the new line and change the direction to Down and the number to 3. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("tower", function () {
    buildTower()
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, False)
    agent.move(LEFT, 3)
    agent.move(DOWN, 3)
})
```

## Step 8
Place the lines of code created in the previous step within a for loop and change the loop to enumerate 2 times.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("tower", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        buildTower()
        agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, False)
        agent.move(LEFT, 3)
        agent.move(DOWN, 3)
    }
})
```

## Step 9
Next let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 10 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://advancedpyv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Start")

2. Reset the activity zone if there is a tower built currently in it. 
3. Open the chat window by pressing the t key and enter the command tower. 
4. Enter the command build and press enter 
5. Notice 2 towers are built.

## Step 11
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
