# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 6.3.1 - Functions Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Functions Activity**

In this activity we will use functions to make sections of our code reusable.

We will take some code which builds a chicken pen and change it to be able to be used in mulitple places in our code.

## Step 2
The below code has been provided which will build a 5 x 5 pen of oak fence with some chickens inside.

Return to the game, move to the center of the island and run the code and observe what happens. 

Return to Code Builder and continue the tutorial after you have run the code.
```template
player.onChat("build", function () {
    blocks.fill(
    OAK_FENCE,
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(4, 0, 4)
    ),
    FillOperation.Replace
    )
    blocks.fill(
    AIR,
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(1, 0, 1)
    ),
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(3, 0, 3)
    ),
    FillOperation.Replace
    )
    for (let index = 0; index < Math.randomRange(1, 7); index++) {
        mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, pos(3, 0, 3))
    }
})
```

## Step 3 @unplugged
If we wanted to build multiple pens there are a number of methods we could use to do this:
- We could copy and paste the code and have the same code multiple times

- We could use a loop around this code 

- We could move the code into a function and call the function multple times

The third option is the preferred option as it means there is only one copy of the code and the code can be called from multiple places.

## Step 4 
At the end of the code create a new function named buildPen by entering the below Python code:

![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson6/6.3.1/images/2.jpg?raw=true "Functions")

This is known as defining a function.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
function buildPen() {

}
```

## Step 5
Move all of the code from the onChat Build event handler to the buildPen function.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
function buildPen() {
    blocks.fill(
    OAK_FENCE,
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(4, 0, 4)
    ),
    FillOperation.Replace
    )
    blocks.fill(
    AIR,
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(1, 0, 1)
    ),
    positions.add(
    pos(2, 0, 2),
    pos(3, 0, 3)
    ),
    FillOperation.Replace
    )
    for (let index = 0; index < Math.randomRange(1, 7); index++) {
        mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, pos(3, 0, 3))
    }
}
player.onChat("build", function () {
    
})
```
## Step 6
For the code in the function to run we need to call the function.

To do this enter the name of the function followed by a set of bracket/parenthesis where you want to call it. In our case we want to call the function in the player.onChat event handler.

Once you have added the code return to the game and test your code out by entering the text build into the chat window and a pen with some chickens should be built.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("build", function () {
    buildPen()
})
```
## Step 7
At the moment there is no difference when running the code - it still create a pen containing chickens near the player. 

What if we wanted to create multiple pens?

The pens are built a few blocks away from the players position so lets teleport the player to a new position for each pen.

After the ` buildPen() ` code add a new line and from the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER: teleport to||`` block on the new line.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("build", function () {
    buildPen()
    player.teleport(pos(0,0,0))
})
```

## Step 8
Place the 2 lines of code created in the previous step within a for loop and change the loop to enumerate 3 times
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("build", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        buildPen()
        player.teleport(pos(0, 0, 0))
    }
})
```

## Step 9
Change the position the player is teleporting to on each loop enumeration to ~6, ~0, ~0 by changin the coordinates in the ```python pos(0, 0, 0)``` code.

This will ensure each pen is 1 block apart.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("build", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        buildPen()
        player.teleport(pos(6, 0, 0))
    }
})
```

## Step 10
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 11 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat window by pressing the t key and enter the command mine. 
3. Enter the command build and press enter 
4. Notice 3 pens with chickens are built

## Step 12
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
