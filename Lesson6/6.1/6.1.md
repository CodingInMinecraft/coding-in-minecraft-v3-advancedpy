# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 6.1 - Python - Syntax Errors

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Python Syntax Errors**

Syntax errors occur when you do not follow the rules of the language.

Syntax errors in Python stop your program from running.

In the MakeCode Python editor syntax errors are usually found automatically and highlighted by being underlined in a red wavy line.

The 3 most common causes of syntax errors in Python are:

- Accidentally deleting a character from a Python statement resulting in the word being mis-spelled.

- Missing a colon (:) in an if, else, for, while, or def statement

- Inconsistent indentation

## Step 2 @unplugged
**MakeCode Python editor & syntax errors**

In this example the editor is highlighting a syntax error on line 6.

There is a syntax error somewhere on the line:

blocks.o_block_placed(GRASS, block_placed_grass)

The red wavy line is usually where the syntax error is (but not always!)

On this occasion there is an error in the word o_block_placed - this should be o**n**_block_placed. (note the missing n)

## Step 3 @unplugged
**MakeCode Python editor & syntax errors**

If you hover the mouse over the error a pop up window will appear suggesting what the error is and how to fix it.

Note: sometimes this message may not be as helpful!

## Step 4 @unplugged
**MakeCode Python editor & syntax errors**

If we fix the error by replacing the missing n the red wavy line should disappear.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Missing a colon**

In this example the editor is highlighting a syntax error on line 4.

![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson6/6.1/images/4.jpg?raw=true "error")

There is a syntax error somewhere on the line:

if noOfBlocks % 5 == 0

The red wavy line is usually where the syntax error is (but not always!)

On this occasion we have forgotten add a colon to the end of the if statement definition after the condition. If we place a colon (:) after the 0 this should fix the error.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Missing a colon**

Again once the error is resolved the red line disappears.

## Step 7 @unplugged
**Case sensitivity**

Python is a case sensitive language.

That means that we need to be careful which letters are in lower case and which are in upper case.

In this example notice line 5 is underlined.

## Step 10 @unplugged
**Case sensitivity**

If you hover the mouse over the underlined word it will give you a suggestion of how to resolve the error.

## Step 11 @unplugged
**Case sensitivity**

Change the p in player from upper to lower case to fix the syntax error.

## Step 12 @unplugged
**Reserved words**

In the Python languages there are various (approx 60) words which are part of the Python language.

Such as:
- def
- break
- if
- pass
- for

If we try to call a variable or function one of these keywords we will create a syntax error.

In this example we have called a variable function - notice it appears as a syntax error.

## Step 13 @unplugged
**Reserved words**

Change the variable name to something which is not a Python keyword to resolve the error.

## Step 14 @unplugged
**Inconsistent Indentation**

Indentation in Python is the spaces and tabs that are used at the beginning of a line of code. The lines of code with the same indentation belong to the same function, if statement or loop

If we do not properly indent our code it can result in a syntax or semantic error (semantic errors will be discussed next).

In this example we have added an additional indent to line 3 of the code.

## Step 15 @unplugged
**Inconsistent Indentation**

If we remove the additional indent it will resolve the error.
