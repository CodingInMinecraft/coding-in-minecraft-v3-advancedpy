Remember to upload your evidence to the Coding in Minecraft Portal when complete.

```python 
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport_to_player()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)
    agent.move(BACK, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(RIGHT, 7)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(UP, 2)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("build", on_chat)
```

```template
player.onChat("build", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.setAssist(AgentAssist.PlaceOnMove, true)
    agent.move(BACK, 1)
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(RIGHT, 7)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(UP, 2)
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})
