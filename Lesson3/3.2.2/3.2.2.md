# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 3.2.1 - Python - Modifying Python code - Activity Part 2

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
This activity follows on from the previous activity so make sure you have completed that first. 

Your code has been copied over below.

```template
player.onChat("sayHello", function on_chat() {
    player.say("Hello player!")
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```

## Step 2
On line 4 delete the word RIGHT_TURN from the agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN).

Replace it with LEFT_TURN.

These are the 2 directions the Agent can turn (Left and Right).

## Step 3
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

Notice this time your agent will turn left rather than right.

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 5
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 6
Take a look at line 5 `agent.move(FORWARD, 1)`

This line of Python is the code which will move the agent in a certain direction by a number of blocks. 

The move method takes 2 parameters - the first one being the direction to move and the second one the number of blocks to move.

## Step 7
Firstly lets look at the first parameter the `FORWARD`

This is one of 6 directions the agent can move in - FORWARD, BACK, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, UP.

Delete the word FORWARD and enter the text RIGHT.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hello player!")
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(RIGHT, 1)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```
## Step 8
The second parameter (the one after the comma) is how many blocks to move and is a number type.

Change this number to 5 to move the agent 5 blocks to the right.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hello player!")
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    agent.move(RIGHT, 5)
    player.teleport(pos(0, 10, 0))
})
```
## Step 9
Next lets test the code.

## Step 10 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

You should have noticed that the Agent now moves 5 blocks to the right.

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 11
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 12
The final line of code teleports the player to a position defined by a set of relative coordinates.

The teleport function of the player takes a position variable to tell it where to teleport the player to.

This coordinate is created using the pos function which takes 3 parameters - the X, Y and Z coordinates.

## Step 13
Change the coordinates to be the relative coordinates of 1 20 -1 by changing the 3 number parameters in the pos function to 1, 20, -1.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("sayHello", function () {
    player.say("Hello player!")
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
    agent.move(SixDirection.Right, 5)
    player.teleport(pos(1, 20, -1))
})
```
## Step 14
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 15 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Start")

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon and enter the word **sayHello** and press enter

Notice this time that you are teleported to a position 1 block to your left, 1 block backwards and 20 blocks above your position (depending on what way you are looking!)

Return to the tutorial by pressing the C key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon on your screen when finished.

## Step 16
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 17 @tutorialCompleted
Click on the Exit Tutorial button at the top of the screen to return to the main Code Builder window and create a new project to try the activity.

Once you have completed the activity move onto the next Non Player Character.
