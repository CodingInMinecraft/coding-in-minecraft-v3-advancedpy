## Step 1 @unplugged

**Creating the algorithm**

Your algorithm should resemble something like the following:

Step 1) Start

Step 2) Get out of bed

Step 3) Shower or get washed

Step 4) Get dressed

Step 5) Eat breakfast

Step 6) Brush teeth

Step 7) Pack school bag

Step 8) Go to school

Step 9) Stop

You may not take the exact same steps or in the same order (e.g. you may eat breakfast before you get dressed) but your algorithm should be able to be understood by others and describe the process.
