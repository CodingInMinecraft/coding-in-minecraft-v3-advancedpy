# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 2.3.1 - Algorithms - Make a sandwich algorithm

### @explicitHints true
### @hideIteration true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will write an algorithm to describe the process you perform when you make a chicken sandwich

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Thinking about the process**

Spend a few moments to think about what you do when you make a chicken sandwich - open the fridge, butter bread, cut sandwich etc

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating the algorithm**

Now you have thought about what things you do to make a chicken sandwich lets create an algorithm to describe the process.

Using pen and paper write your algorithm down.

When you have completed your algorithm continue to the next step.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Creating the algorithm**

Your algorithm should resemble something like the following:

Step 1) Start

Step 2) Open fridge

Step 3) Remove chicken and butter/spread/mayonnaise from fridge and place on counter

Step 4) Close fridge

Step 5) Open bread bin

Step 6) Remove bread from bread bin and place on counter

Step 7) Open cutlery drawer

Step 8) Remove bread knife and butter knife from drawer and place on counter

Step 9) Close cutlery drawer

Step 10) If bread is in a wrapper

Step 11) If bread is not sliced remove whole loaf from wrapper, otherwise remove 2 slices and go to step 13

Step 12) Use bread knife to slice 2 slice

Step 13) Place slices of bread on counter/breadboard

Step 14) Remove the lid from the butter/spread/mayonnaise container

Step 15) If a seal or paper exists on the top of the container then remove

Step 16) Using the bread knife place some of the butter/spread/mayonnaise on each piece of bread

Step 17) Spread the butter/spread/mayonnaise evenly

Step 18) Replace the lid on the butter/spread/mayonnaise container

Step 19) Open container which contains chicken pieces

Step 20) Place some chicken pieces on one of the slices of bread

Step 21) Close the chicken container

Step 22) Take the piece of bread with no chicken and place it on top of the other piece of brad with chicken, ensuring the butter/spread/mayonnaise side is facing down

Step 23) Cut the sandwich if needed into halves or quarters

Step 24) Place the sandwich on a plate

Step 25) Open fridge

Step 26) Return chicken and butter/spread/mayonnaise to the fridge

Step 27) Close fridge

Step 28) Place dirty knives in the sink

Step 29) Clean work area

Step 30) Done

You may not take the exact same steps or in the same order but your algorithm should be able to be understood by others, describe the process and end up with the correct result.
