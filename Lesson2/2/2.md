**Writing an Algorithm - Example - Sorting numbers**

Can you work out what the list would look like as the steps in the algorithm were processed for the below 5 number list?

4, 2, 3, 1, 5

The list would look like the below through the process:

- The first time the loop of steps 2-6 runs the list would be processed as below:

        -- 4, 2, 3, 1, 5 (4 and 2 compared and swapped as 2 is less than 4)

        -- 2, 4, 3, 1, 5 (4 and 3 compared and swapped as 3 is less than 4)

        -- 2, 3, 4, 1, 5 (4 and 1 compared and swapped as 1 is less than 4)

        -- 2, 3, 1, 4, 5 (4 and 5 compared and not swapped as 5 is greater than 4)


- As there were values swapped we need to run again (Step 7) resulting in the below processing:

        -- 2, 3, 1, 4, 5 (2 and 3 compared and not swapped as 4 is greater than 2)

        -- 2, 3, 1, 4, 5 (3 and 1 compared and swapped as 1 is less than 3)

        -- 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 (3 and 4 compared and not swapped as 4 is greater than 3)

        -- 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 (4 and 5 compared and not swapped as 5 is greater than 4)


- As there were values swapped we need to run again (Step 7) resulting in the below processing:

        -- 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 (2 and 1 compared and swapped as 1 is less than 2)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (2 and 3 compared and not swapped as 3 is greater than 2)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (3 and 4 compared and not swapped as 4 is greater than 3)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (4 and 5 compared and not swapped as 5 is greater than 4)


- As there were values swapped we need to run again (Step 7) resulting in the below processing:

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (1 and 2 compared and not swapped as 2 is greater than 1)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (2 and 3 compared and not swapped as 3 is greater than 2)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (3 and 4 compared and not swapped as 4 is greater than 3)

        -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (4 and 5 compared and not swapped as 5 is greater than 4)


- As there were no values swapped we can continue to step 8 and end as the list is now in order
