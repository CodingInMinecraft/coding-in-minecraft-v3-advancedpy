## Step 1 @unplugged
**Creating the algorithm**

Your algorithm should resemble something like the following:

Step 1) Start

Step 2) Put on your shoes

Step 3) If its wet or cold then put on a jacket

Step 4) Open front door

Step 5) Leave house with parent/guardian

Step 6) Close front door

Step 7) Lock front door

Step 8) If the park is far away then drive, otherwise walk to park

Step 9) Stop

You may not take the exact same steps or in the same order (e.g. you may put your jacket on before your shoes) but your algorithm should be able to be understood by others and describe the process.
