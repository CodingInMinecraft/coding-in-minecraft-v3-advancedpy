**Boolean Operators in Python**

Boolean operators are also known as logical operators and allow us to create more complex decision structures for logic statements and loops.'

e.g. we can determine if a variable is in a certain range or make a decision based on the value of 2 or more variables.

There are three logical operators in Python:

- ```or``` 
- ```and``` 
- ```not``` 

## Step 2 @unplugged
**```or``` operator**

We can use the or operator to create a more complex condition which is made up of 2 (or more) conditions and should either one of the conditions be true the more complex condition is true.

e.g. in the above code snippet if the health variable is 0 or the gametime variable is 0 (or both are 0) the code inside the if statement will run, the code inside the if statement will not run only if both variables are not 0.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**```and```**

We can use the and operator to create a more complex condition which is made up of 2 (or more) conditions which when evaluated will result in true only if all parts of the condition are true.

**Python**

e.g. in the code snippet above only if the health variable is 0 and the gametime variable is 0 the code inside the if statement will run, the code inside the if statement will not run only if either (or both) variables are not 0.


## Step 4 @unplugged
**```not```**

We can use the not operator to reverse the value of a boolean.

If the variable is false and we apply the not operator to it then it returns true and if the variable is true and we apply the not operator to it then it returns
false.

e.g. in the code snippet above only if the gametime is NOT greater than 0 (i.e. is 0 or less than 0) then the code inside the if statement will run
