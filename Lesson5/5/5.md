## Step 1 @unplugged
**Python Logic**

Logic is used in computer programs to allow different sections of code to run depending on the result of a boolean condition.

Logic can also be know as selection and are mostly IF THEN or IF THEN ELSE statements.

For example the steps we may take in our daily routine may vary been weekdays (Monday to Friday) and weekends (Saturday & Sunday). Using logic we could determine if the day is a weekday or weekend day and run separate code for each condition.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**IF THEN Statements**

The IF THEN statement allows you to run a series of lines of code only if a certain condition is true.

This could be for example if the agent detects a certain type of block mine it and gather it.

**MakeCode Blocks**
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    if (true) {
        
    }
})
```

## Step 3 @unplugged
**IF THEN ELSE Statements**

IF THEN ELSE statements are an extension of the IF THEN statement and allows us to run a series of lines of code if a condition is true otherwise run a different series of lines of code (as the condition is false).

This could be for example if the agent detects a grass block below it then till the soil, plant some seeds and move onto the next block otherwise if its a different type of block below it then move onto the next block.

**MakeCode Blocks**
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    if (true) {
        
    } else {
    
    }
})
```

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Comparison Operators**

Comparison operators allow you to compare 2 variables and determine if they are equal or not equal, one is less than or equal to the other or one if greater than or equal to the other. The comparison results in a boolean value of true or false.

They are typically used as conditions in IF THEN statements or loops.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Boolean Operators**

Sometimes decisions are not as simple as being based on one variables value.

Sometimes you may need to take a certain path based on the comparison of 2 variables and only if these 2 comparisons are both true then take that path.

We can expand the condition in an IF statement to use a boolean operator to expand the condition of the IF statement to be based on 2 comparisons.

We can use boolean operators to expand the condition of an if statement to be based on multiple comparisons.
