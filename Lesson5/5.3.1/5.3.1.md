# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 5.3.1 - Python - Boolean Operators Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Boolean Operators Activity**

In this activity we will use boolean operators to turn our agent into a gold miner!

We will write some code which will cause our agent to continuously mine forward until it reaches gold.

## Step 2
If there is any code in the code editor delete it and continue to the next step. 

## Step 3 
From the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER: run code on chat command jump ||`` block on line 1.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    pass
player.on_chat("jump", on_chat)
```

## Step 4 
Change the chat command to respond to the command mine rather than jump by changing the text jump to mine.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    pass
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```

## Step 5
Delete the default `pass` code and from the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT: agent teleport to pos facing dir||`` block  on line 2 to bring the agent to your location.

Change the oritentation parameter to EAST.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```
## Step 6
Add a new line after line 2 and from the ``||LOOPS: LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS: while||`` block on line 3 after the line of code agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST) on line 2.

We will use this while loop to continuously move the agent forward and mine whilst the block in front of the agent is not a gold block or an air block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while True:
        pass
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```
## Step 7
Delete the default `pass` code and from the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer place a ``||AGENT: agent destroy direction||`` block and an ``||AGENT: agent move direction by 1||`` block inside the while loop on lines 4 and 5.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while True:
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```
## Step 8
At the moment the condition of the while loop is true - this means the loop will continuously run, forever.

We want to change this behaviour so that the loop will only run if the block in front of the agent is not either a gold block or an air block.

## Step 9
To do this we will use the ``||AGENT: agent inspect kind direction||`` block to check the type of block in front of the agent - do not place it yet - we will place it later.

Delete the word true from the condition in the while statement on line 3 so we can build up a more complex condition for the while loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while  :
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```

## Step 10
Add the code
```python
() or ()
```
in-between the brackets of the while statement to start setting up the complex comparison we will perform in the while loop. 

This is setting up an or boolean condition between the 2 conditions inside the brackets on either side.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while () or ():
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```
## Step 11
Inside the first set of brackets we will check the block in front of the agent to see if it is a gold block.

Inside the second set of brackets we will check to see if the block in front of the agent is an air block.

Inside the first set of brackets place an ``||AGENT: agent inspect kind direction||`` block from the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)) or ():
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```

## Step 12
After the closing bracket for the inspect command put a space and a double =
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)==) or ():
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```
##Step 13
After the == enter the code 
```python
GOLD_BLOCK
```
to test for a Gold Block.

This now results in the first part of the comparison checking the block in front of the agent to see if it is a gold block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)==GOLD_BLOCK) or ():
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```
## Step 14
Next we need to build up the right hand side of the or comparison. This side will check the block in front of the agent to see if it is an air block. We are checking if it is an air block as we do not want the agent to mine forever!

In the set of brackets after the or operator place an ``||AGENT: agent inspect kind direction||`` block from the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)==GOLD_BLOCK) or (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```

## Step 15
As we have done previously for the left hand side of the or operator after the closing bracket for the inspect command put a space and a double = symbol
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)==GOLD_BLOCK) or (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)==):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```
## Step 16
As we done earlier after the == enter the code
```python
AIR
```
to test for an air Block.

This now results in the second part of the comparison checking the block in front of the agent to see if it is an air block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)==GOLD_BLOCK) or (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)== AIR):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```
## Step 17
Our code will now run but the logic is not correct.

The code within the while loop will run while the block in front of the agent is a gold block or an air block.

**This is not the action we want to happen.**

What we want to happen is the code within the while loop runs when the block in front of the agent is **not** a gold or air block.

To do this we first place an opening bracket before the first opening bracket of the while loop and a closing bracket after the last bracket of the while loop (before the : - on line 3 in the code)
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while ((agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)==GOLD_BLOCK) or (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)== AIR)):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)



```
## Step 18
Finally add a not operator between the while and the first bracket of the while loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport(pos(0,0,0), EAST)
    while not((agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)==GOLD_BLOCK) or (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.BLOCK, FORWARD)== AIR)):
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
player.on_chat("mine", on_chat)
```

## Step 19
This results in reversing the result of the comparison within the brackets which is:
```python
(agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, FORWARD) == GOLD_BLOCK) or (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, FORWARD) == AIR)
```

Therefore if the block in front of the agent is a gold block or an air block this comparison would normally result in true. 
Performing a not operation on this result will mean the loop will run only if the block is not either of these blocks.

## Step 20
Next lets test the code.

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Start")

1. Position yourself directly in front of one of the lines of blocks.

![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson5/5.3.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Test")

2. Open the chat window by pressing the t key and enter the command mine. 
Notice the agent should destroy all blocks until it reaches a gold or air block.
Test your code out but mining all 5 rows of blocks - the agent should stop when they reach an air block or a gold block.
