# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 5.1 - Python - IF THEN and IF THEN ELSE in Python

### @explicitHints true


## Step 1 @unplugged
**IF THEN and IF THEN ELSE in Python**

The most basic form of logic is a simple IF THEN statement. This allows you to run one or more lines of code should a condition be true.

An extension of the IF THEN statement is the IF THEN ELSE statement. This allows you to run one or more lines of code should a condition be true or run one or more different lines of code should the condition be false.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**IF THEN Statement**

The IF THEN statement is made up of 1 line of code and the code you want to run should the condition evaluate to true be intented one level below this line.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**IF THEN Statement**

**Python**

This example shows the IF THEN statement in its basic state with no lines of code within it to run.

Line 2 contains the main functionality of the IF THEN statement and can be broken down into two sections:

The word if indicates this line of code is an IF THEN statement and the word True is the boolean condition to determine if the code within the IF THEN statement will be run. By default this is the boolean true value therefore the code within the IF THEN statement will always be run. You will normally always replace this true with a comparison to determine if the code should be run or not.

All lines of code which you want to run only when the boolean condition is true should be placed below this line of code and indented.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**IF THEN Statement - Example**

**Python**

In this example we have placed an IF THEN statement inside a for loop.

The for loop will run 10 times.

The first line in the for loop (line 3) is the IF THEN statement.

The condition for the IF THEN statement has been changed from the default of true to agent.detect(AgentDetection.BLOCK, FORWARD) - this is a method of the agent which will detect if a block is at a certain position - in this instance in front of the agent.

If there is a block in front of the agent the code on line 4 will run which is destroying the block.

Outside of the IF THEN statement but still inside the loop (as it is indented under the loop) is the agent.move statement which will cause the agent to move forward by one every time the loop enumerates.

Essentially this block of code will cause the agent to move forward by 10 blocks (one block at a time) and destroy any blocks in its way.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**IF THEN ELSE Statement**

The IF THEN ELSE statement is made up of 2 lines of code and the code you want to run should the condition evaluate to true should be placed indented under the if statement and the code you want to run should the condition evaluate to false should be placed indented after the else statement.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**IF THEN ELSE Statement**

**Python**
![alt text](https://advancedpyv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson5/5.1/images/5.jpg?raw=true "Python")

This example shows the IF THEN ELSE statement in its basic state with no lines of code within it to run.

Line 2 contains the main functionality of the IF THEN ELSE statement and can be broken down into two sections:

The word if indicates this line of code is an IF THEN statement and the text True is the boolean condition to determine if the code within the IF THEN statement will be run. By default this is the boolean true value therefore the code within the IF THEN statement will always be run. You will normally always replace this true with a comparison to determine if the code should be run or not.

All lines of code which you want to run only when the boolean condition is true should be placed after this line and indented. 

On line 4 is the word else. This word indicates this is an IF THEN ELSE statement rather than an IF THEN statement. Following the else word is another section of code indented by 1 level. Any code you want to run should the boolean condition in the if statement evaluate to false should be placed after the else statement and indented.

## Step 7 @unplugged
**IF THEN ELSE Statement - Example**

**Python**
![alt text](https://advancedpyv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson5/5.1/images/6.jpg?raw=true "Python")

In this example we have placed an IF THEN ELSE statement inside a for loop in the goldmine function.

Line 3 is the beginning of the IF THEN ELSE statement.

The condition for the IF THEN statement has been changed from the default of true to agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, FORWARD) == GOLD_ORE - this is a boolean comparison (which we will look at further later)
which will be true if the block in front of the agent is a Gold Ore block.

If the condition evaluates to true (i.e. the block in front of the agent is a Gold Ore block) the agent will destroy it and collect it.

If the condition evaluates to false (i.e. the block in front of the agent is not a Gold Ore block) the line of code in the else part of the statement will run - in this instance the agent turns left and moves forward by 1.
