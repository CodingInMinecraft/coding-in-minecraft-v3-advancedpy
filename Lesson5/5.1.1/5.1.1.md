# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 5.1.1 - Python - IF THEN and IF THEN ELSE in Python Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**IF THEN and IF THEN ELSE in Python Activity**

In this activity we will create an IF THEN ELSE statement in Python

We will create some code which will detect if we are walking on ice or not.

## Step 2
If there is any code in the code editor delete it and continue to the next step. 

## Step 3 
From the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER||`` drawer drag out a ``||PLAYER: run code on player method||`` block and drop it onto the code editor to create an event handler which will run when the player walks.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    
})
```

## Step 4 
From the ``||LOGIC: LOGIC||`` drawer place a ``||LOGIC: if else||`` block on line 2 inside the event handler to create and IF THEN ELSE statement.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (true) {

    } else {

    }
})
```

## Step 5
Delete the default True condition on line 2 (careful not to delete the colon!)

##Step 6
From the ``||BLOCKS: BLOCKS||`` drawer place a ``||BLOCKS: test for block at pos||`` block inside the brackets on line 2.

This function will check for a certain type of block (a grass block by default) at a coordinate position and returns true if the blocks exists at that position or false if the block does not exist at the position.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(GRASS, pos(0,0,0))) {

    } else {

    }
})
```

##Step 7
Change the first parameter in the 
```
blocks.testForBlock(GRASS, pos(0,0,0))
```
to be ICE and the second parameter to be pos(0, -1, 0).

The pos(0, -1, 0) creates a relative coordinate which is the block under the players feet.

This will result in the block below our players feet being checked to see if it is an ice block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(ICE, pos(0,-1,0))) {

    } else {

    }
})
```

##Step 8
Remove the default pass statement from the if section of the statement and from the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER: say(":)")||`` block on line 3 inside the first section of the IF THEN ELSE statement.

This line of code will run when the block below the players feet is ice.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(ICE, pos(0,-1,0))) {
        player.say(":)")
    } else {

    }
})
```

##Step 9
Change the text in the say function to Careful you do not slip on the ice! (ensure you keep the double quotes!)
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(ICE, pos(0,-1,0))) {
        player.say("Careful you do not slip on the ice!")
    } else {

    }
})
```

##Step 10
Remove the default pass statement from the else section of the statement and from the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER: say(":)")||`` block on line 5 inside the second section of the IF THEN ELSE statement.

This line of code will run when the block below the players feet is not ice.

Change the text of the say command to Find some ice!
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
    if (blocks.testForBlock(ICE, pos(0,-1,0))) {
        player.say("Careful you do not slip on the ice!")
    } else {
        player.say("Find some ice!")
    }
})
```
## Step 11
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 12 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Walk around the current island.

![alt text](https://advancedpython.codingcredentials.com/Lesson5/5.1.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Test")

3. Notice that when you walk on the ice blocks on the island a message saying Careful you do not slip on the ice! appears and at all other times a message Find some ice! appears

## Step 13
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 14 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next Non Player Character.
