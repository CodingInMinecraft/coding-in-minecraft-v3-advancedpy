## Step 1 @unplugged
**For Loops Activity 2**

We will make changes to our program so the Agent not only walks but farms the land also.

## Step 2
Place the cursor at the end of line 3 (the 2nd for loop) and press the return key to add a new line.
```template
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        } 
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left) 
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)   
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)   	
    }   
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        } 
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left) 
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)   
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)   	
    }   
})
```

## Step 3 
To farm we need to till the ground and then place seeds.

From the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT: agent till direction||`` block on line 4 and place a new line after it.

On the new line place an ``||AGENT: agent place direction||``  block on line 5 after the till line to add code to have the agent place forward.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
            agent.till(FORWARD)
            agent.place(FORWARD)
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            
        } 
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)    
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)   	
    }   
})
```

## Step 4
Next let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 5 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Before we begin we need to get some seeds from the chest.

3. Place the seeds in the Agents inventory, slot 1 by right clicking on the agent and moving the seeds from your inventory to the agent inventory.

4. Open the chat and run the farm command.

5. Your agent should till the land and place seeds on all the grass blocks. Now you will get an error when the agent tries to place seeds on the wood blocks - ignore these at the minute as we will look at how we
could fix this later.

## Step 6
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 7 @tutorialCompleted
Great job working with loops in Python!
