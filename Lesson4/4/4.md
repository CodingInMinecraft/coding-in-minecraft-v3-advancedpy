## Step 1 @unplugged
**Python Loops**

Loops are used in computer programs to perform the same operation multiple times.

Looping can also be known as iteration or repetition.

In MakeCode Blocks there are 3 common types of loop:
- Repeat
- For
- While

These are equivalent to 2 types of Python loop:
- For
- While

In Python the MakeCode Block Repeat loop is a Python For loop.

There are times when you have to repeat the same series of steps multiple times - e.g. building a series of identical structures, farming or mining. Using loops allows you to repeat the same lines of code multiple times.

Some loops are similar and the same result can be achieved using different type of loops.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Repeat Loops**

Repeat loops will repeat a series of code statements a specified number of times.

**MakeCode Blocks**
```blocks 
player.onChat("turn", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
    }
})
```

## Step 3 @unplugged
**While Loops**

While loops will repeat a series of code statements whilst a boolean condition is true.

**MakeCode Blocks**
```blocks 
player.onChat("turn", function () {
    while (true) {
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
    }
})
```

## Step 4 @unplugged
**While Loops - Boolean Conditions**

A boolean condition is a condition that evaluates to either true or false.

By default the boolean condition is true which means the code in the loop will run continuously forever. This is not what you would typically want therefore you would normally change this default true condition to be a loop control variable you change in your loop when you want it to stop or a boolean condition to control when the loop will stop.

If the loop control variable is false to begin with the code in the loop will not run!

## Step 5 @unplugged
**For Loops**

For loops will repeat a series of code statements depending on the value of a loop control variable.

Every time the loop enumerates the loop control variable is automatically increased by 1.

The name of the loop control variable and its starting and ending values can all be changed to suit your requirements.

**MakeCode Blocks**
```blocks 
player.onChat("turn", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index <= 8; index++) {
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)
        agent.place(SixDirection.Back)
    }
})
```
