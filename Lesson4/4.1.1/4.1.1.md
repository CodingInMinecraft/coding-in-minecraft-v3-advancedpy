## Step 1 @unplugged
**Repeat Loops Activity**

In this activity we will create and modify for loops in Python.

We will create a loop which will create a set of stairs for us.

## Step 2
If there is any code in the code editor delete it and continue to the next step. 

## Step 3 
From the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER ||`` drawer drag out a ``||PLAYER: run code on chat command jump||``. block and drop it onto the code editor surface at line 1.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    pass
player.on_chat("jump", on_chat)
```
## Step 4 
Change the text jump to stairs to change the event handler to respond to the command stairs.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    pass
player.on_chat("stairs", on_chat)
```

## Step 5
Delete the default `pass` command and from the ``||LOOPS: LOOPS ||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS: for ||``  block of code on line 2 to add the below for loop. 

```python 
    for i in range(4):
        pass
```

Notice the default loop control variables name is i and the loop will run 4 times.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    for i in range(4):
        pass
player.on_chat("stairs", on_chat)
```

## Step 6
Change the value of end condition for the loop to 10 by changing the 4 to a 10 in the `in range(4)` part of the for loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    for i in range(10):
        pass
player.on_chat("stairs", on_chat)
```

## Step 7
Delete the default `pass` command in the loop and from the ``||BLOCKS: BLOCKS ||`` drawer place a ``||BLOCKS: fill with block from to to operator ||`` block inside the loop at line 3 to generate the below code:
```python 
blocks.fill(GRASS, pos(0, 0, 0), pos(0, 0, 0))
```

This fill function of the block takes 3 parameters - the block to use to fill and the start and end coordinates to fill between.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    for i in range(10): 
        blocks.fill(GRASS, pos(0,0,0), pos(0,0,0))
player.on_chat("stairs", on_chat)
```

## Step 8
By default it will use Grass blocks to fill.

Replace the word GRASS with the word COBBLESTONE to use Cobblestone blocks instead.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    for i in range(10): 
        blocks.fill(COBBLESTONE, pos(0,0,0), pos(0,0,0))
player.on_chat("stairs", on_chat)
```
## Step 9
The final 2 parameters are coordinates.
```python
pos(0, 0, 0)
```
creates a coordinate position relative to the player.

The first pos(0,0,0) represents the start point of where you want to fill.

Change this to set a relative position which is 2 blocks to your right (when first run as i is 0) and is where the staircase will start. 
To do this change the first 0 (the X coordinate) to i+2.
```python
pos(i+2, 0, 0)
```

We use the value of i+2 so that every time the loop enumerates the position we are laying blocks at will be increased by 1.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    for i in range(10): 
        blocks.fill(COBBLESTONE, pos(i+2, 0, 0), pos(0, 0, 0))
player.on_chat("stairs", on_chat)
```
## Step 10
The second pos(0,0,0) represents the end point of where you want to fill.

Change this to be i+2 on the X axis and i on the Y axis as below 
```python
pos(i+2, i, 0)
```
This sets a relative position 2 blocks + i to your right and i blocks up on the Y axis.

This should mean that the first time the loop is run the value of i is 0 therefore the 1st coordinates will be ~2 ~0 ~0 and ~2 ~0 ~0 and one block will be placed 2 blocks to your right.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_chat():
    for i in range(10): 
        blocks.fill(COBBLESTONE, pos(i+2, 0, 0), pos(i+2, i, 0))
player.on_chat("stairs", on_chat)
```

## Step 11
The second time the loop runs the coordinates will be ~3 ~0 ~0 and ~3 ~1 ~0 and two blocks will be placed 3 blocks to your right.

The loop will continue to run another 8 times whilst i has a value of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and result in a set of steps being built.

## Step 12
Next let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

##Step 13 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Move to the stand right in front of the activity zone and run the command stairs in the chat window.

3. A set of stairs should be built 2 blocks to your right - remember that depending on the way you are facing the x axis may not be your right hand side!

## Step 14
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 15 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next Non-Player Character.
