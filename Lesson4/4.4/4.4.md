Note there are 4 changes you need to make.

Dont forget to give your Agent some inventory they can build with!

```python
def on_chat():
    agent.teleport_to_player()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for x in range(4):
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        for y in range(4):
            for z in range(9):
                agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
                agent.place(UP)
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
player.on_chat("build", on_chat)
```

```template
player.onChat("build", function () {
    agent.teleportToPlayer()
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    for (let x = 0; x <= 3; x++){
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        for (let y = 0; y <= 3; y++){
            for(let z = 0; z <= 8; z++){
                agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
                agent.place(UP)
            }
            agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
        }
    }  
})
```
