# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 4.2.1 - Python - While Loops Activity

### @explicitHints true


## Step 1 @unplugged
**While Loops Activity**

In this activity we will create and modify while loops in Python.

We will create a program which will tell us if we are walking on grass until we walk on another type of block.

## Step 2
If there is any code in the code editor delete it and continue to the next step. 

## Step 3 
From the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER: run code on player method||``  block onto the code editor surface

This block will create an event handler which by default will run when the player walks.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_travelled():
    pass
player.on_travelled(WALK, on_travelled)
```

## Step 4 
Delete the default `pass` command and from the ``||LOOPS: LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS: while||`` block on line 2.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_travelled():
    while True:
        pass
player.on_travelled(WALK, on_travelled)
```

## Step 5
Delete the default `pass` command and from the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER ||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER: say ":)"||``block betweent he word while and the closing colon of the while loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_travelled():
    while True:
        player.say(":)")
player.on_travelled(WALK, on_travelled)
```

## Step 6 
Change the text :) to You're walking on grass! to change the text that will be displayed as a chat message.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_travelled():
    while True:
        player.say("You're walking on grass!")
player.on_travelled(WALK, on_travelled)
```

## Step 7 
At the moment if you run the program the while loop will run continuously as its boolean condition is always true. 
We want to change this. 
We will change it so that the code inside the while loop will only run when we are on top of a grass block.

To do this delete the word True (leaving the :) on line 2 bring a ``||BLOCKS: test for block at pos||`` block out from the ``||BLOCKS: BLOCKS||`` and place it where the word True was (after the while and before the :)
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_travelled():
    while blocks.test_for_block(GRASS, pos(0,0,0)):
        player.say("You're walking on grass!")
player.on_travelled(WALK, on_travelled)
```
## Step 8 
The blocks.testForBlock method takes 2 parameters - the first one being the type of block to check for and the second one being the coordinate position to check.

Ensure the block that is being checked for is a GRASS block to test for grass blocks.

## Step 9 
Change the second parameter pos(0,0,0) to pos(0, -1, 0) to check the relative coordinate of ~0 ~-1 ~0 which is the block below our players feet
#### ~ tutorialhint
```python
def on_travelled():
    while blocks.test_for_block(GRASS, pos(0,-1,0)):
        player.say("You're walking on grass!")
player.on_travelled(WALK, on_travelled)

```

## Step 10
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 11 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Walk around the island ensuring you walk over the grass blocks on the island.

3. You should see a chat message constantly appear when you are on top of a grass block (and stop when you move off a grass block).

## Step 12
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 13 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next Non Player Character
