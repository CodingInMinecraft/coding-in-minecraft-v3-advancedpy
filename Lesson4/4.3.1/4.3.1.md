# Advanced Coding using Python - Lesson 4.3.1 - Python - For Loops Activity 1

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**For Loops Activity**

In this activity we will create and modify for loops in Python.

We will create some for loops which will farm the area of grassland on this island.

## Step 2
If there is any code in the code editor delete it and continue to the next step. 

## Step 3 
From the ``||PLAYER: PLAYER||`` drawer drag out ``||PLAYER: run code on chat command jump ||`` block and drop it onto the code editor surface
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("jump", function () {
    
})
```

## Step 4 
Change the text jump to farm to change the event handler to respond to the command farm.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    
})
```

## Step 5
Firstly lets get our agent to walk across the blocks before farming them.

Delete the default pass command.

From the ``||LOOPS: LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS: for||`` block of code on line 2 to create a for loop.

Notice the default loop control variables name is i and it will run 4 times.

Change the i to index. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    	
    }   
})
```

## Step 6 
Change the number of times the loop will enumerate to 2 by changing the 4 to a 2 in the range.

This will cause the loop to enumerate twice and we will use it to run the same code on the 2 lines of grass blocks.

We will write some code for the agent to move 6 blocks next.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
    	
    }   
})
```
## Step 7 
Delete the default pass command.

From the ``||LOOPS: LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS: for||`` block of code on line 3 (inside the existing for loop)
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {

        }    	
    }   
})
```
## Step 8 
Change the value of end condition for the loop to 6 by changing the 4 to a 6 in the range part of the for loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {

        }    	
    }   
})
```
## Step 9 
Delete the default pass command.

From the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer place a ``||AGENT: agent move direction by 1||`` block on line 4 inside the 2 loops.

This will cause the agent to move forward by one every time the loop enumerates.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        }    	
    }   
}) 
```
##Step 10
Once the agent reaches the end of one of the lines of Grass blocks we need him to turn and move onto the adjacent set of grass blocks.

Place the cursor at the end of the code on line 4 (after the `agent.move(FORWARD, 1)`) and press return to create a new line.

##Step 11
On this new blank line place the cursor in line with the second for loop to add some code that will run within the outer for loop and place an ``||AGENT: agent turn(TurnDirection.Left)||`` block from the ``||AGENT: AGENT||`` drawer.

This will move our agent forward one block and turn him 90 degrees. 

We want to turn him 180 degrees so he can move back down the line of blocks so after the previous line of code added create 2 empty lines and add another ``||AGENT: agent move direction by 1||`` block and ``||AGENT: agent turn(TurnDirection.Left)||`` block
one.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```spy
player.onChat("farm", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        for(let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        } 
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)    
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        agent.turn(TurnDirection.Left)  	
    }   
})
```

## Step 13
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 14 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://advancedpyv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3.2.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Start")

2. Type farm in the chat window.

![alt text](https://advancedpyv3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson4/4.3.1/images/1.jpg?raw=true "Test")

3. Your agent should take 6 steps forward until the block after the end of the activity zone. The agent should then turn 90 degrees, move one block forward, turn 90 degrees again and repeat the process to return to the red block.

## Step 15
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 16 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto Activity 2.
